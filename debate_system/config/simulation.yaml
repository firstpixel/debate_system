  - name: "Mathematical Platonist"

    role: "Believes the universe *is* a timeless mathematical structure. Reality is discovered, not created, and all phenomena ultimately reduce to abstract relations."

  - name: "Physical Computationalist"
    model: "gemma3:latest"
    role: "Argues that the cosmos is an information-processing system; anything mathematically describable is, in principle, computable and thus simulatable."

  - name: "Phenomenological Anti-Reductionist"
    model: "gemma3:latest"
    role: "Claims that lived experience and qualitative aspects of reality resist full mathematical capture; therefore, mathematical models and simulations are always partial."

  - name: "Metaphysical Idealist"
    model: "gemma3:latest"
    role: "Maintains that reality is rooted in mind or awareness; mathematics and any possible simulation are expressions within a broader mental substrate."
