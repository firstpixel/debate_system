## üü© Final Consensus Block
### ü§ù Consensus Summary:
This debate demonstrates a fascinating tension between a pragmatic, adaptation-focused perspective (TechAdvocate) and a more cautious, ethically-grounded viewpoint (Ethicist). While both sides acknowledge the transformative potential of AI, they diverge significantly on the *speed* and *nature* of that transformation, particularly concerning the definition of ‚Äúfull human jobs.‚Äù The Delphi analysis confirms a strong core of agreement (65%) regarding task automation and the need for workforce adaptation, but highlights critical points of contention regarding AI‚Äôs future capabilities and the long-term impact on human roles.

**Key Points & Shared Conclusions (75% Convergence):**

*   **Task Automation as the Primary Driver:** Almost universally agreed that AI‚Äôs initial impact will be the automation of specific tasks within existing jobs. This is the most robust area of consensus.
*   **Workforce Adaptation:** Both sides acknowledge the need for workforce retraining and adaptation to the changing landscape.
*   **Initial AI Limitations:** Both recognize that current AI systems are primarily based on pattern recognition and statistical correlation.
