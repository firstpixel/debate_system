Okay, please provide me with the data for the Final Consensus Block. I need the following information to perform my audit:

1.  **The Text of the Summaries:**  I require the full text of each summary presented in the final consensus block. This is the core data I need to assess the arguments.

2.  **Agent Belief Metrics Table:**  The data from the table – Agent, Coherence (numerical score or qualitative rating), Drift (numerical score or qualitative rating), Contradictions (number or qualitative rating), and ⚠️ Flag (present/absent).

3.  **Contradiction Logs:** The complete text of the contradiction logs.  I need to see *exactly* what contradictions were identified and how they were categorized.

4.  **Agent Belief Snapshots:** The data from the agent belief snapshots.  This will give me a timeline of belief shifts.

5.  **Argument Graph Summary:**  The visual representation of the argument structure.


Once you provide this data, I will meticulously analyze it and deliver a comprehensive audit report, including:

*   **Logical Consistency Assessment:**  I'll evaluate whether the arguments follow a sound logical structure and whether the conclusions genuinely follow from the premises.
*   **Belief Coherence Evaluation:** I’ll assess the internal consistency of each agent’s beliefs and how well they align with the overall consensus.
*   **Contradiction Pattern Analysis:** I’ll identify the types of contradictions (e.g., logical, factual, temporal) and their severity. I’ll also look for patterns in how contradictions are being handled.
*   **Argument Structure Critique:** I’ll assess the overall structure of the arguments – are they well-organized, clear, and persuasive?
*   **Strengths & Flaws Identification:** I’ll highlight the strongest aspects of each argument and pinpoint any weaknesses or fallacies.
*   **Recommendations for Improvement:**  I'll suggest specific changes to strengthen the arguments or address identified flaws.


I'm ready when you are.  Let's get started!  Please paste the data here.
