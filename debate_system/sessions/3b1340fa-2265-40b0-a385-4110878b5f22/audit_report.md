Okay, here’s a detailed audit of the debate, incorporating your feedback and aiming for a robust, actionable assessment.

**Overall Assessment:**

The debate is characterized by a significant, but not overwhelming, level of disagreement. The 35% convergence figure is a reasonable approximation, reflecting a shared acknowledgement of the need for proactive planning and a recognition of the potential for AI to reshape the workforce. However, the core philosophical differences – particularly regarding the *nature* of human work and the potential for AI to fundamentally alter our sense of purpose – remain a significant point of contention. The debate is largely framed around a reactive versus proactive approach, with TechAdvocate advocating for adaptation and Ethicist emphasizing the need for a more critical and potentially transformative response.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **TechAdvocate’s Strengths:**
    *   **Clear and Persuasive Argument:** TechAdvocate presents a well-structured and logically sound argument, leveraging historical precedents (printing press, steam engine) to build a case for adaptation.
    *   **Focus on Opportunity:** The emphasis on “exhilarating transformation” and the creation of new roles is a key strength, attempting to frame AI not as a threat, but as an opportunity.
