TechAdvocate and the Ethicist fundamentally disagree on the nature of this transition, with TechAdvocate advocating for a proactive, skills-based approach focused on augmenting human capabilities, while the Ethicist warns against reducing human value to quantifiable metrics and prioritizing human flourishing. Delphi analysis confirms a strong convergence on several core issues, particularly regarding AI\u2019s role in automation and the continued importance of human skills.\n\n**Key Points & Arguments:**\n\n* **TechAdvocate:** Defines \u201cfull human job\u201d as demanding complex, unstructured problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and creativity \u2013 skills AI currently lacks. Proposes a national AI Skills Accelerator to proactively equip individuals with these skills.  Emphasizes human-AI collaboration and the use of AI to identify skills gaps.\n* **Ethicist:** Argues that AI\u2019s \u201cproblem-solving\u201d is inherently reliant on pre-existing data and lacks genuine creativity or subjective experience.
